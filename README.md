# minesweeper
Minesweeper game for CASIO graphing calculators written in the CASIO built in programming language.

There is a formatted version with spacing in the 'formatted' folder for readability, but the actual file does not allow for spacing as that will give a syntax error when running the program on a calculator.

There are many features I haven't added yet, including not getting out on the first try, going
through walls, adjustable board size, winning automatically instead of having to check manually,
and holding down on a number with the expected amount of flags surrounding it to reveal all the 
remaining adjacent squares. Not easy when dealing with the very slow CASIO language, but we'll see.

Enjoy!
