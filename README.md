# minesweeper
Minesweeper game for CASIO graphing calculators written in the CASIO built in programming language.

There is a formatted version with spacing in the 'formatted' folder for readability, but the actual file does not allow for spacing as that will give a syntax error when running the program on a calculator.

There are many features I haven't added yet, including not getting out on the first try, going
through walls, adjustable board size, winning automatically instead of having to check manually,
and holding down on a number with the expected amount of flags surrounding it to reveal all the 
remaining adjacent squares. Not easy when dealing with the very slow CASIO language, but we'll see.

To install, copy the MINE.txt file to the storage memory of your calculator (that's anywhere except the file titled @MainMem). Then navigate to 'Program' on your calculator, select 'LOAD', and find the .txt file.

Enjoy!
